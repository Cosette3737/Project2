# <p align ="center">Group D - Too Fast, Too Furious? A Data Driven Look at Formula 1 Racing </p>

### Chosen Topic and Rationale: 
We've chosen this dataset and topic because there is a variety of data in this dataset to examine. The proposal has a variety of interesting visualization ideas that we've decided to run with.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020

Inspiring Imagery:
1. Our first idea is creating a dashboard with data on the top 5 drivers of all time with a dropdown menu to switch from driver to driver.

2. Our next is to create a visualization of the number of wins per country that transitions from the beginning of our data to the end and shows perhaps the top 10 countries.

3.To further illustrate the data in #2, we will create a heat map displaying data on all wins by country using MapBox to create it.
